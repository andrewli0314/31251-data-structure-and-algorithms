# Why Functional Programming

- Pure functions are simple in design making them understandable.
- Without classes and by emphasizing pure functions our code is easier to debug and test
- Since we lack mutable state, multi-threading is achieveable.

**Functional Programming Style**:

- We try to avoid data mutations so all of our variables tend to be _immutable_ (Immutable is just a fancy word for a constant).
- If we can not change variables, loops are difficult, so _recursion_ is preffered.
